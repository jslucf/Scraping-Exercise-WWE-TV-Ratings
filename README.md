Scraping-Exercise-WWE-TV-Ratings
2/2/17

This was my first attempt to scrape data from a website using the rvest package in R. I attempted to scrape an online database of all TV ratings for the WWE from 1984 to January 2017, which was stored in 55 different web pages.

I then did some basic analysis on the rapid decline in audience of their flagship show, Raw, since the show expanded to three hours in 2012.
