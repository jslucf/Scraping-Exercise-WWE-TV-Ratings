# Scraping-Exercise-WWE-TV-Ratings
# 2/2/17

"Scraping data - WWE ratings" was my first attempt to scrape data from a website using the rvest package in R. I attempted to scrape an online database of all TV ratings for the WWE from 1984 to January 2017, which was stored in 55 different web pages on http://wrestlingdata.com/index.php?befehl=quoten. 

I then took some time to clean up and prep the data for analysis. A CSV of all Raw and Smackdown data as of 1/31/17 is included. 

Finally, I did some exploratory analysis and visualization on the rapid decline in viewership of their flagship show, Raw, since the show expanded to three hours in 2012. This can be found in the R script, "WWE TV Viewers Analysis".
